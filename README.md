# Data Visualization and Machine Learning with Iris Dataset

In this project, we will be working on Iris dataset to classify the flowers species, we will follow the whole machine learning project lifecycle and also we will deploy it using flask. Below is the whole outline that we will be following.

# Introduction

The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis.

- The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).
- Four features were measured from each sample (in centimetres):
    - Length of the sepals
    - Width of the sepals
    - Length of the petals
    - Width of the petals

- Loading the imporatant libraries  
- Loading and understanding the Iris data 
- Exploring the data 
- Visualizaing the data  
    - Checking if our data is skewed or not using countplot.  
    - We will plot the grids for every species. 
- Checking Null Values
- Dividing the data 
- Model Development 
    - Using Lr, SVM, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting 
    - Calculating loss  
    - Training on every algorithm 
    - Choosing the best 
- Saving the Model
